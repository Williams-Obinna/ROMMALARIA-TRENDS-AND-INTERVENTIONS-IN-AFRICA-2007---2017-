# Malaria Trends in Africa (2007â€“2021)

This project presents a Microsoft Excel-based data analysis of malaria trends across African countries. It explores how infrastructure, healthcare interventions, and access to clean water influence the spread, treatment, and prevention of malaria over time.

---

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To analyze malaria incidence and treatment-related indicators in Africa between 2007 and 2021. This includes examining how factors such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), antimalarial drugs, IPT coverage for pregnant women, and access to sanitation and water services relate to reported malaria cases.

---

## Key Findings

- Nigeria, DRC, and Mozambique consistently report the highest malaria case numbers.
- Bed net usage is low in several high-incidence countries, especially among children under 5.
- IPT (intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy) is underutilized in many countries.
- Access to safe water and basic sanitation services correlates with lower malaria incidence.
- Rural populations are more affected and often underrepresented in reported data.

## Dataset Summary

**Included Worksheets:**
- `DatasetAfricaMalaria`: Contains all core data points on malaria incidence and health indicators.
- `Pre-Analysis Board`: Used for early data exploration and validation.
- `In-Analysis Board`: Includes pivot tables, metrics, and insights by region and year.
- `Dashboard For Malaria Trends`: A visual summary of the analysis with slicers and charts.
- `Final Observation and Recommend`: Consolidated recommendations based on trends.

**Data Source:**  
Data compiled from the World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO).

## Methodology

**Tools Used:**
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH
- AVERAGEIFS and COUNTIFS
- Conditional Formatting
- Excel Dashboards

**Approach:**
- Time-series and trend analysis by country and region
- Correlation of malaria incidence with treatment and prevention coverage
- Infrastructure-focused segmentation (urban vs. rural)

---

## Recommendations

1. Expand IPT access to pregnant women in low-coverage, high-risk regions.
2. Increase distribution and correct use of insecticide-treated bed nets in rural areas.
3. Improve data reporting and completeness, especially for underrepresented regions.
4. Integrate malaria control with WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) initiatives.
5. Enhance community education around prevention and early treatment.

## How to Use This Project

1. Open the Excel dashboard to explore key metrics filtered by year, country, and indicator.
2. Use pivot tables in the `In-Analysis Board` for deeper exploration.
3. Read the `Final_Report.pdf` for a full breakdown of findings, recommendations, and conclusions.
